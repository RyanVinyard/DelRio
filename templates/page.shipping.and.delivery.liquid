    <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>

    <p>At Del Rio Vineyard Estate, we are just as devoted to superior customer service as we are to 
      producing quality wines. Whether you're shopping with us online, by phone or at our tasting room, 
      you can count on our helpful team to answer any questions you might have along the way.</p>

    <p>We love that we can connect and provide wine through delivery. Our main shipping provider is 
      UPS. Orders placed by 12pm PST on Monday through Thursday will ship the same day. Orders 
      placed after 12pm will ship the next applicable shipping day.</p>

    <p>During special promotions, please allow up to 3 business days for your order to be charged and 
      processed, plus the estimated shipping timeframe for the shipping option you have selected. A total 
      of three delivery attempts will be made before the shipment is returned to our facility. If you have 
      any questions about your order or its delivery status, please 
      <a href="mailto:taste@delriovineyards.com">email</a> 
      or give us a call at (541)855-
      2062.</p>

    <h2>Adult Signature Required</h2>

    <p><strong>Alcohol delivers must be signed for by an adult 21 or older. Verification of age is required at 
      the time of delivery.</strong>
      We recommend use of a business address to facilitate delivery of your 
      purchase. We cannot ship to P.O. Boxes, as signatures are required. Wine will not be delivered to a 
      visibly intoxicated person. Failure to produce age verification forfeits the right to receive the 
      shipment until identification is produced. In such circumstances, the order may be held in storage 
      at a local depot of the shipping company until appropriate identification is produced, or it may be 
      shipped back to the winery. All associated costs will be the responsibility of and be charged to you, 
      the customer.</p>

    <h2>Weather</h2>

    <p>To protect your wine purchase, we may need to delay shipment to avoid extreme weather 
      conditions (hot or cold). We will notify you if we are concerned about weather conditions.</p>

    <p>Wine is a perishable commodity. Wine does not like extremes of temperature: hot humid summer 
      and cold winter weather may adversely affect the condition of your wine during shipment. Del Rio 
      Vineyards offers, in addition to ground rates, expedited Next Day Air and 2nd Day Air Delivery 
      Services via UPS as an option for safe delivery. </p>
